New version is to be safer (and hopefully faster) than the old version.
- Support for configuration file
- Proper CLI argument support (not just a bunch of if statements lol)
- yay style warnings (missing debug packages, currently installed out of date packages, etc)
- old json library has no error handling. Replace with something else
        - Maybe add option to compile with either?
- Better Makefile
- snsystem is unsafe. Build argv and use exec instead.
- PATH_MAX is an unreliable constant.
- Fuzz testing
- Unit tests
- Handle interrupts more gracefully.
- Make functions only used within the file static.
- sizeof(char) redundant
- better codebase structure?
- support doas, not just sudo
- new README

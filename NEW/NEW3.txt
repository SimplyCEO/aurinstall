GOALS:
- as few requests to the AUR RPC as possible

Installing multiple packages:
- if installed, check for new version and update.
- create dependency list 
- for each package, parse pkgbuild
- for all dependencies, check repos for them, if not found, add to list of packages to query AUR for.
- make request
- if some metadata is missing, that package does not exist in repos or AUR, therefore fail.
- perform above few steps parsing all required dependencies
- prompt user
